I really am. What happens in your life, in your car and in your marriage should not be a public issue. Unfortunately, because you are a public figure, sometimes your private life does become public. I guess it comes with the territory and maybe you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re used to it by now. It still must bite, though......Of course I long for you to own your mistakes, Tiger. If you aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t already, and I hope you are, man up to the pain you caused your wife and family. Let the hot searing anger she has for what you did change you, not harden you. It must be a hard road to walk, both for her dealing with what you have done, and for you, making sense of where to go from here when you are in the public eye the way you are. Stand behind your actions by way of fully admitting and acknowledging them to yourself. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lie to yourself or pretend they aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as bad as others think or that somehow you were justified. You weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. You are reaping what you sowed, Tiger. Own it. But see, whether you acknowledge all that publicly to your fans is entirely up to you. It makes no difference to me if your public apologies are detailed or not. For it is not us you need to be apologizing to. Because you are well known does not make you accountable to the public. Share only what you want, and keep the rest private. Keep it all private, if you can. But, and I speak from painful experience here, coming entirely clean does feel good. Really good....\\\\n\\\\nTonight, I am praying for restoration for your marriage. Having almost lost mine, because of my own sin and pride as well as that of my husband, I now hold redemption in marriage in such high regard....But my advice, as someone who has been there? Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hide it. Own it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Change your ways. Feel repentance. Apologize to your wife. Seek counseling, lots of it if you can. Let the searing pain and guilt and remorse you hopefully feel inspire in you to see yourself for what you are: A wretched sinner in need of forgiveness.\\\\n\\\\nYou, your heart, and that of your wife and children are what matter. Focus on them, on saving your marriage, if that is what you want to do. And truly, my husband and I pray that it is what you want to do."\\\\n\\\\n"'

He spurred the creation of the tea party. He helped the GOP win the House majority in 2010 and make big gains in the Senate. His Obamacare has helped revive the Commerce Clause and given a boost to conservative jurisprudence. His refusal to support human rights has caused a bipartisan revulsion and reminded us that foreign policy must be girded by American values. He\\u2019s sent independents running into the GOP\\u2019s arms. He\\u2019s forced conservatives to think hard and express eloquently principles of religious liberty, limited government, free markets and Constitutional democracy.\\n\\nObama also has wreaked havoc in the the Democratic Party. He\\u2019s firmly affixed the \\u201ctax and spend\\u201d label to it after Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. He\\u2019s made Clinton into a pitch man for Mitt Romney. His rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline has split the party. His refusal to adopt the Simpson-Bowles commission\\u2019s recommendations has turned Democrats into reactionaries, defending the status quo on entitlements. He\\u2019s alienated Jewish voters. He\\u2019s re-McGovernized the party, which now stands for appeasing despotic powers, turning on allies and slashing defense spending.\\n\\n(Pack it up dude, your eviction notice will be delivered in November)"'

S'"How A CSM Works. \\n   After a hand is over the cards just used are placed back into the shuffler to be mixed with the other cards in the shoe. Shuffle Master\\u2019s King uses an elevator system to randomize the cards. As the elevator is moved up and down, cards are randomly inserted into one of the 19 shelves in the elevator. The shuffler randomly selects a shelf of cards to deliver into the shoe. Because of the non-linear process, every discard re-inserted following a hand has a chance of appearing in the next round.   Although Shuffle Master says The King differs from their competitors continuous shufflers because the others use a linear design most CSMs so the same thing. They put the discards back into play and does away with the dealers having to stop to physically shuffle the cards at the end of a shoe. \\nThe House Edge    The continuous shufflers have no benefits for the player and has been dubbed the "uncomfortable shoes". It eliminates card counting for the skilled player and will also have a major disadvantage for the basic strategy player. It speeds up the game! \\nWhen the CSM was first introduced many players felt it would probably increase the house edge. As it turns out this is not entirely true. Michael Shackleford, The Wizard of Odds did a mathematical analysis of the Continuous Shuffling Machines and found that there was a very slight reduction in the house edge. \\nIn a four deck game the edge is 0.034 percent and in an eight deck game is tis0.014 percent. Before you get excited about a slight reduction in the house edge you have to realize that when the casino uses a CSM the speed of the games is increased by about 20 percent. The basic strategy player stands to lose more in the long run because they are exposing more money to the house edge. \\nAs a player I feel it\\u2019s a treat to visit a casino that offers double and single deck games. I would hate to see these games eliminated altogether. Even a multi deck shoe game is preferable to the Continuous Shuffling Machines. The best way you can let the casinos know this is by refusing to play Blackjack at the casinos that use a CSM for their Blackjack games"'

You don\'t have to look like a runway model, but YOU DO need to look like you take care of yourself, eat reasonably well, and exercise.  Studies have shown (though I\'m referencing information I read YEARS ago) that WM actually prefer a larger body type than WW, but not as large as BM or HM.  WW seem to want to be a size zero, while WM seem to like the athletic Swedish model body.  Anyway, I think both of the ladies above look very attractive.  However, I don\'t understand this fixation on having butts and thighs that are WAY out of proportion with the rest of one\'s figure.  That isn\'t attractive to me, personally.  I just don\'t get it.  And, seeing a HUGE rear on a small girl just doesn\'t make any sense.  I don\'t know how it\'s physically possible to have skinny arms, legs, waist, and still have a humongous derriere and/or thighs.  Many men like a nice-sized butt, including WM and AM (I know from experience), so a BW\'s full, round bottom isn\'t necessarily a problem for men in general.  But, MOST men (including BM) don\'t want a bottom that\'s so obese it looks like it\'s own planet.  Get and stay in shape for your own health and opportunities, BW."'

I have no clue what Trayvon did in his last seconds of life.  We know he was shot from between 1 and 18 inches, in the chest, which is consistent with Zimmerman\'s story.  Trayvon had at least a few seconds of life after he was shot, and who knows what his reaction was...  judging from how his body was found, he crawled off Zimmerman and died.  You don\'t have to roll someone over to check their pulse at the neck.\\n\\nI\'m not quite able to figure out just what you\'re suggesting, but his position at death is irrelevant."'

Next their going to want to pass laws that being a rapist is just sexual orientation. You would even see ignorant people trying to say the bible says its ok.

He didn\\\\\'t do anything when he was in congress and time after time he ABANDONED HIS PRINCIPLES TO PLEASE THE LIBERALS IN PENNSYLVANIA! And what did it buy him?  A 19 point drubbing in his re-election!\\\\n\\\\nAs for the campaign, he\\\\\'s brought no rational or reasonable solutions to the table - instead, like mitt, his best solution has been to say "I agree with Newt"  - and his economic logic is elementary and fatally flawed.  Newt has been spot on predicting where king hussein obama is leading us, including the attack on the church, which is simply the avenue to establish the legal precedent that the WH has the power to tell us - all of us - how to act, how to respond, and what to think!  That\\\\\'s the real issue from obama and his henchwoman michellivelli!  Not only will rick be behind on tidal wave of rot that will flood him if elected, he will not be able to get congress to do a darn thing!  And when his failed 4 years are over, the demonic dems will come back to power with a vengence by simply pointing at rick\\\\\'s miserable record and lack of ability to lead in a hail storm of enemies on both sides of him!  \\\\n\\\\nSo rick should just suck it up, stop whining and run the gauntlet like Newt has had to ... if he can\\\\\'t stand the heat then he can\\\\\'t lead the country!"'

If both opinions are not provided then only ONE opinion will be weighed. Readers deserve both. The difference is that you stood for yourself, not for Elisa or Jory. SGK leaders weren\\\\\'t so transparent, they instead used the entire organization to front their personal mission.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nOur online "voice votes" carry far more weight than the political elections. Once women understand that, they\\\\\'ll understand their responsibility to say what they think often, loudly, and with civility.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nI am very dismayed by SGK\\\\\'s stand because it is playing to politics and not helping women. I will not be supporting SGK any longer. There are many places that are more focused in their mission to help all women, Planned Parenthood is one of them. When I was a starving college student, PP was my primary health screener.

S'"<strong>Whom the Gods Would Destroy</strong>\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nIt seems that<strong> Obama, in a classic act of hubris, has created the means of his own destruction.</strong>  Through his great historical contribution, his health care bill, he has struck what was surely<strong> intended to be a lethal blow against the oldest organization on earth -- an organization with something on the order of a billion members, with a cadre of hundreds of thousands of highly trained and dedicated personnel, and a history of overcoming political threats that make Obama look like a kindergartner.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\'m referring, of course, to the Catholic Church</strong>.  Now, I don\\\\\'t mean that the Archangel Gabriel will appear out of the East to scourge the administration with a blazing sword, though I would pay to see that.  What I\\\\\'m saying is that <strong>Obama has at last taken the step that we all knew he had in him, the ultimate act of arrogance and contempt that will bring the forces of history down upon him.</strong>\\\\n\\\\nThe left has always underestimated the Catholic Church.  "<strong>How many divisions has the pope?" Stalin once asked Molotov, mocking the Church\\\\\'s powerlessness in the modern era.  He was not around to see John Paul II rend the Bolshevik kingdom in twain at the climax of the Cold War, utilizing the only forces he required: moral certainty and absolute faith in the divine mission.</strong>  Most American leftists are a little different, viewing the Church as an anachronism, obsessed with medieval ideas having no place in the third millennium and populated with strange figures in outmoded clothing, if not with an endless parade of child-molesters.  \\\\n\\\\n<strong>What they overlook is two thousand years of history</strong>.  An organization does not survive for that length of time -- and no other organization has -- without internalizing things not completely understood by even the deepest thinkers among us.  <strong>\\\\n\\\\nThe Church survived the fall of Rome, the barbarians, the first Muslim upsurge, several schisms, the Renaissance princes, the 20th-century totalitarians, and its own plunges into decadence, and it will also survive modernism.</strong>  Which is in fact what it confronts in Obama: a man of vast though superficial sophistication and little insight who has punched all the tickets available to him in his epoch and culture and truly believes there is nothing else. <strong> And now this man, afraid of revealing his own college transcripts, thinks he can take on the Church of Peter, founded a millennium before the appearance of any nation now existing on this earth.</strong>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead more:'

I should have guessed that eventually we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be arguing over whether \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOccupy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d has a problem with crime, notwithstanding the long, long, long, long, long list of alleged criminal activities at the encampaments. Remember, things at Zuccotti Park got so bad that a women-only tent was set up so that there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be strength in numbers against sexual predators. Some feminist sites criticized \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOccupy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for its rape problem back during the movement\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brief heyday; even HuffPo reported on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmultiple incidents of assault, drug dealing and drug use, rape and attempted rape, according to conversations with numerous protesters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Per Breitbart in the clip, that detail apparently didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make it into their book.) And of course, we only know about some of what went on. At least one \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOccupy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d camp reminded victims that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe do not encourage the involvement of the police in our community\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and a New York City cop told Big Journalism\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Joel Pollak that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are many incidents of sexual touching and groping that goes unreported to us, mainly because the alleged victim is either too stoned or high to properly ID them or they \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98dont want to get the guy in trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (Some national media outlets reported on the attacks too.) This is why, of course, Breitbart was yelling at the Occupiers outside CPAC to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cstop raping people,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d but now that the movement is gearing up for a big spring comeback, I guess it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time for the left\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whitewash to being in earnest. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nice bookend to their demagoguery over the Tucson shooting: In that case, tea partiers were blamed for a crime that no tea partier committed whereas here no Occupiers are blamed for a crime that quite a few Occupiers allegedly committed. Fourteen minutes, but well worth it.\\\\n\\\\nvideo\\\\n\\\\nhttp://hotair.com/archives/2012/02/14/video-breitbart-vs-cenk-uygar-over-rape-at-occupy-camps/"'

Durin the time when his wife made a announcement that her cancer had returned and was found to be incurable.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had determined that the real estate finance firm and others like it were \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cscams\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the congresswoman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s measure would have overturned a federal ban that would have allowed the shady enterprises to keep raking in lucrative profits..For years the firms acted as a middleman to help sellers finance down payments so that low-income buyers could qualify for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The lobbyist who paid Waters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 husband represented the nation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s largest such middleman (Sacrament-based Nehemiah Corp.), which stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the ban wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t reversed by friendly lawmakers like Waters. .Implemented in 2008, the federal ban was never overturned but not for lack of effort on Waters\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 part. The ten-term congresswoman sponsored legislation three times to stop the ban or repeal it once it became law. She claims she did it because the program allowed hundreds of thousands of low-income families to become homeowners. .News of this latest scandal comes as the House Ethics Committee prepares to try Waters for using her influence to steer $12 million in federal bailout funds to a failing bank (that subsequently got shut down by the government) in which she and her board member husband held shares. .A few months ago the congresswoman got in trouble again for skirting federal elections rules with a crooked fundraising gimmick that allows her to receive unlimited amounts of donations from certain contributors. Instead of raising most of her campaign funds from individuals and political action committees, Waters sells her endorsement to other politicians and political causes for as much as $45,000 a pop, allowing her to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in short periods of time. **************Neil Goldschmidt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Democrat \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Oregon governor.

S'">A fully reserved Tyranid army built right can indeed exploit the current Internet meta lists.\\\\n\\\\nHow? You make this claim several times but don\\\\\'t present any kind of strategy, evidence, or anything else. How are you "exploiting the meta"? How does the army deal with mechanized lists and mobile armies?\\\\n\\\\n>The long answer is yes but it will require near perfect play and some degree of luck.\\\\n\\\\nWhy do you feel that a reserve army with perfect play/good luck can beat top tier lists, but other armies cannot? What makes it more effective in this regard?\\\\n\\\\n>I\\\\\'ve also noticed that kill points are not often chosen as a primary \\\\nobjective at other events such as those that use the P/S/T format\\\\n\\\\nI can\\\\\'t speak for your experience, but most such events that I\\\\\'ve seen have three objectives that are randomly allocated priority, making KP no more or less common than the others. Moreover, giving up KP is hardly the main disadvantage of the list; others rank much more significantly.\\\\n\\\\n> Note that roughly 75 percent of your army should arrive during the second turn\\\\n\\\\n:| Math, huh?\\\\n\\\\n>Many of the units in my army are fast due to fleet so I can quickly redeploy much of my army as the game progresses\\\\n\\\\nFleet doesn\\\\\'t make you any faster than anything else. Other infantry can Run, and tanks are flat-out faster than you thanks to being able to move 12" automatically rather than hoping for a good roll.\\\\n\\\\n> Imperial Guard armies heavily rely upon their Chimeras to protect their\\\\n scoring units so you want to prioritize targeting their transports...\\\\n\\\\nAgain, how do you actually kill transports? The lists you present usually feature very little AT. Your Zoanthropes and Trygon are the only units that will be able to consistently kill tanks.\\\\n\\\\n>At the end of the day though the results are the same\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94no major wins for \\\\nTyranids in fifth edition at any big events and I don\\\\\'t believe that is \\\\ngoing to change while fifth edition is still in effect.\\\\n\\\\nEntirely true- at this point, I don\\\\\'t think that Tyranids are likely to take any major events, as too many factors are stacked against them. It\\\\\'s not impossible to win with them, but especially in environments where mech lists are common they will struggle. So do you really think that your own list is going to be able to achieve this- that you\\\\\'ll get "near perfect play and some luck" six or seven games in a row against other skilled generals to actually win a top spot?\\\\n "'

These countries, especially India should rethink their relationship with Iran and cooperate with the sanctions.

S'"i\\\\\'m directing this comment only to the my fellow chelsea supporters.\\\\n\\\\ni for once agree with AVB. I think he should be strict with these big name players. If you are manager of this team you need to be strict. Avram Grant was too soft. Scolari too soft. Ancelotti in his 2nd year too soft. Are they still our manager... no. By time we have a manager that does things his own way and not play to their tune. At least he can (if he is sacked) say he did things his way, unlike the other scared managers afraid to touch drogba, anelka, lampard and Terry. Too long have these "big personality" players rule Chelsea. Remember in the 3rd season of Jose\\\\\'s reign when we lost the league to untd, early that season Drogba wanted to leave as he was sulking most of the champions previous 2 years and after Jose left, he sulked even more causing lot of negativity in the camp. OH and remember the champs final the sent off AND ANELKA\\\\\'S MISSED PENALTY????? then the next year Scolari became manager he sulked even more and caused again negativity in the team. my point is when he doesn\\\\\'t sulk we win things. Players like Drogba, Malouda, Anelka, Lampard and Terry get paid lots of money per week to be professional and to give their best. CLEARLY AND THEIR SHOULD BE NO ARGUAMENTS FROM CHELSEA SUPPORTERS WHEN I SAY NONE OF THESE PLAYERS THIS YEAR ARE PERFORMING WELL ENOUGH TO BE IN 1ST TEAM YET THEY ARE DEMANDING FIRST TEAM ACTION. MALOUDA IS A WAISTE OF TIME, MONEY AND A PLACE IN THE TEAM. If this was Sir Alex instead of AVB then Man untd fans would have supported him, i\\\\\'m asking, can we not do the same with AVB. I\\\\\'m a big fan of Jose, but i think AVB is perfect for Chelsea as soon as the older players leave in the summer we will see the true CHELSEA.. We are set to buy Willian, Hazard, Christensen and Neymar. Players such as Paizon coming through next season. IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING SQUAD FOR NEXT SEASON.\\\\n\\\\n                                      TORRES - STURRIDGE- NEYMAR\\\\n\\\\nMATA  -  ESSIEN- ROMEU -   RAMIREZ - PAIZON -MEIRELES -  HAZARD WILLIAN\\\\n\\\\n                                     COLE- CAHILL-TERRY-LUIZ-IVANOVIC\\\\n\\\\n                                                           CECH\\\\n\\\\ncome on i know you are smiling as a chelsea fan and i know you are worried as a non chelsea fan.

S'"Ten Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong\\\\n\\\\n01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.\\\\n02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\\\\n03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.\\\\n04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn\'t changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can\'t marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.\\\\n05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears\' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.\\\\n06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn\'t be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren\'t full yet, and the world needs morechildren.\\\\n07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.\\\\n08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours,the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That\'s why we have only one religion in America.\\\\n09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That\'s why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.\\\\n10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven\'t adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans."'

As far as "Stop trivializing violence" goes. Why dont you stop sounding like a big ass c*** sucker and don\\\\\'t play games with violence then. I get so tired of all these holy sounding types that get touchy about video game violence.\\\\n\\\\n I\\\\\'ve seen Blood Diamond a dozen times with the kids killing and getting killed and it doesn\\\\\'t even phase me one bit only because its not real, sure there is an emotional sense there but not enough to make me write to Hollywood saying gay sh*t like Stop trivializing violence because its disgusting. Why does a game have to tone it down when movies don\\\\\'t? I\\\\\'m not defending COD in the slightest, and that\\\\\'s because I don\\\\\'t really care about the game. But when I read the headline of the article I was curious to see what others were going to say, but I knew hands down it was going to be an attempt to throw punches at a series that has sold a lot of copies already. All I can say is, it doesn\\\\\'t matter how "YOU" feel when every other gamer that plays the game probably can just deal with the game no matter if it changes or not.\\\\n\\\\n Sitting on your overgrown ass complaining about a game being this and being that just because you don\\\\\'t like it is stupid as hell. I hate JRPG games and why I also hate Anime with a passion because I can\\\\\'t stand cute crap, I hate that overly sensitive BS with the characters, I don\\\\\'t like Japanese music either unless its instrumental War drums or something out of Samurai Warriors or Kessen where it doesn\\\\\'t begin and end with a stupid Asian chick trying to sound like shes an innocent little annoying 11 or 13 year old...I hate high pitch whiny sounding voices too and no Japanese voice acting does not mean better over American voice acting because it still sucks regardless. \\\\n\\\\nBut I don\\\\\'t go near the stuff (even though my brother plays JRPG games a lot, and that means I can\\\\\'t really escape it when we\\\\\'re both in the same room and I\\\\\'m studying while he\\\\\'s just playing his sissy games). The fact still stands that I don\\\\\'t INTENTIONALLY go near things I hate just so I can whine about hating it like COD haters constantly go near Call of Duty to claim that they hate the game when its easier to just simply stay away from it, don\\\\\'t buy it, try to pretend like it doesn\\\\\'t even exist. I will not lie to anybody. I like violence in my games. People that walk around with a d*ck up there ass crying foul about CGI characters dying and getting hurt probably scream when the doctor comes at them with a needle. As far as Call of Duty having to change goes. Well, that depends on whether or not a lot of people want it to change, and not just the people that bash the game on a consistent basis either. I\\\\\'m talking about people that really feel or believe it should change a few things and have accurate reasons why. Just simply saying "COD is for 13 year olds and needs to change this or that"...If anything the COD players are the ones that should change."'

As a credentialed and educated professional in my field it has become quite disturbing to work with the environment that Service Magic has created, i.e. a false sense of qualification of vendors to the consumer. I have spoken with many arborists from other firms in our region and all say the same thing. This could have been a beneficial service, but without demanding proper insurance and credentials from its vendors it simply becomes a means for the unlicensed and uninsured vendors to gain business they are not qualified to perform. This also leaves the qualified professionals, such as myself, without a fair cost comparison to offer our clients. The fact of the matter is, companies pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for proper insurance, not to mention the cost of education to aquire proper credentials. Service Magic comes along and opens up an outlet for those who have not performed their due diligence in aquiring these necessary benchmarks to practice their craft to be solicited to the masses as "qualified vendors". It\\\\\'s a shame and has become a menace to the integrity of my profession and those of us who have worked hard and payed countless dollars to make ourselves a true qualified vendor. My hope is that the people at Service Magic make immediate change in their qualification of vendors."'

These are the same people who think gays should be executed, atheists should have their citizenship revoked, and that the first amendment means you have the freedom to choose what type of Christian you want to be. They say they want to return us to a "Christian Nation" and that we need to base our laws on Old Testament Biblical Law. Go back and look at some of the stuff Bryan Fischer, Mike Huckabee, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin have both said and endorsed. Look at some of the statements Rick Perry\\\\\'s advisers have made, and things Jim DeMint has said. They feel they have been commanded to take over government, the entertainment industry, the church, etc. \\\\xc2\\\\xa0These people have more influence than they should, and enough to be dangerous. Their followers are probably naive when it comes to what their leaders are advocating and will continue to push their agenda without considering the consequences. Some of the Tea Party have tried to introduce legislation to pass personhood amendments (which are bad enough) but also to charge women with felony murder if they miscarry but are unable to prove they had nothing to do with it. I have no idea how they would go about autopsying an 8 week old fetus, but women would be guilty until proven innocent. Please see last part of post in regards to capital punishment. This is what DeMint and crew advocate. These people are dangerous, and over 45% of the House of Representatives either actively endorse, or are sympathetic, to these nuts:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nhttp://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/02/evangelicals_an_1.html\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\n\\\\nFor some fun reading, here are some links: "prenatal murder"\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/26/georgia-lawmakers-anti-abortion-proposal-punish-women-miscarriages/\\\\n\\\\nall sorts of craziness linked on this website:\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\nhttp://www.rightwingwatch.org/\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\n\\\\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/14/dominionism-michele-bachmann-and-rick-perry-s-dangerous-religious-bond.html\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\nhttp://www.theocracywatch.org/biblical_law2.htm\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\n\\\\nhttp://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre1.html\\\\xc2\\\\xa0\\\\n\\\\nCapital PunishmentEpitomizing the Reconstructionist idea of Biblical "warfare" is the centrality of capital punishment under Biblical Law. Doctrinal leaders (notably Rushdoony, North, and Bahnsen) call for the death penalty for a wide range of crimes in addition to such contemporary capital crimes as rape, kidnapping, and murder. Death is also the punishment for apostasy (abandonment of the faith), heresy, blasphemy, witchcraft, astrology, adultery, "sodomy or homosexuality," incest, striking a parent, incorrigible juvenile delinquency, and, in the case of women, "unchastity before marriage."According to Gary North, women who have abortions should be publicly executed, "along with those who advised them to abort their children." Rushdoony concludes: "God\\\\\'s government prevails, and His alternatives are clear-cut: either men and nations obey His laws, or God invokes the death penalty against them." Reconstructionists insist that "the death penalty is the maximum, not necessarily the mandatory penalty." However, such judgments may depend less on Biblical Principles than on which faction gains power in the theocratic republic. The potential for bloodthirsty episodes on the order of the Salem witchcraft trials or the Spanish Inquisition is inadvertently revealed by Reconstructionist theologian Rev. Ray Sutton, who claims that the Reconstructed Biblical theocracies would be "happy" places, to which people would flock because "capital punishment is one of the best evangelistic tools of a society."The Biblically approved methods of execution include burning (at the stake for example), stoning, hanging, and "the sword." Gary North, the self-described economist of Reconstructionism, prefers stoning because, among other things, stones are cheap, plentiful, and convenient. Punishments for non-capital crimes generally involve whipping, restitution in the form of indentured servitude, or slavery. Prisons would likely be only temporary holding tanks, prior to imposition of the actual sentence.""'

S'"Randal, regarding your first paragraph above, what articulett said!\\n\\nRegarding you second paragraph, you really don\'t see what you are forced to do here, do you? It\'s what I see you arguing on your blog and in our co-written book. You stretch things to suit what you believe. You use improbabilities to conclude a probability. You do this all of the time, almost in every case. \\n\\nTake my speculation that most non-believers, especially former Christians, have heard many of the \\nthings you say in this book, but most Christians have not considered the \\nthings I say in it. (that\'s how I meant the sentence per aritculett).\\n\\nFirst off, when it comes to FORMER CHRISTIANS we were scared to death to seriously doubt our faith. We were scared because of the threat of hell if we get it wrong. You probably do not understand this. When the time comes for you to seriously doubt your faith you will understand it. At that point you must be convinced your faith has almost no probability to it at all in order to reject it, since that is the\\xa0 point where Pascal\'s Wager has no more force on us. So we investigated it thoroughly, most of us. The more educated we are in our faith then the more we must investigate it. So it\'s more likely what you have said in our book will be things most former Christians have considered before.\\n\\nI have a mountain of anecdotal evidence for this as well. Almost every Christian I have spoken to always learns something from me and I have learned little or nothing from them. This scenario repeats itself every time I have a disunion with a Christian, and can be seen from the responses to my blog over a six and a half year period. I teach them. They do not teach me.\\n\\nWhen it comes to NON-BELIEVERS in general studies have shown that non-believers know more about the Bible than Christians. That\'s evidence, baby. The probability therefore\\xa0 that non-believers will not learn as much from you in our book is more likely, than otherwise.\\n\\nSo these speculations of mine have evidence for them. Evidence. That\'s what I\'m talking about, here, there, and in our co-written book. You must skirt it at almost every step in order to believe. \\n\\nAnd you provide some evidence that this is what you do here. You compared the probabilities of my speculations with predicting how many people will get rained on next February 18th. I did not say how many believers would learn more from me than you, nor did I speculate how many skeptics would not learn as much from you. I only speculated than MOST believers would learn more from me. Most, as defined as above 50%, minimally. You however compared my speculations with prediction of how many people would get rained on next February 18th. That\'s asking someone to specify a mathematical number of people who will get rained on. You are also asking for the impossible, or the near impossible, since no one can predict what the weather will be like on one part of the planet seven months from now (charitably assuming that\'s your comparison rather than asking someone to predict the number of people who will get rained on globally). w\\n\\n*ahem* there is absolutely NO comparative parity here at all.\\n\\nThis is what I see you do all of the time.\\n\\nThe unfortunate thing is that I have to spend 15-20 minutes explaining this to your deluded mind. That\'s a waste of your mind in my opinion, a waste of an otherwise bright mind who would never use it in like this in any other area of life except when it comes to your faith.\\n\\nNot only that, but I predict you are not done defending this utterly ignorant comparison.\\n\\nYou do realize that I\'ve stopped wasting so much time blogging because of Christan like you, correct? Your reasoning abilities when it comes to your faith is just that bad, sorry. I have no hopes of convincing you jsut as I have no hopes of convincing a leader in Scientology. You cannot be argued out of your faith because you were never reasoned into it in the first place.\\n\\nThere is only hope for others."'

The town of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania claims to have celebrated the first Decoration Day in 1868. Carbondale, Illinois claims to have celebrated it first on April 29, 1866.

He spent all of his time hanging out with prostitutes and the poorest of the poor telling rich people it would be very hard for them to get into heaven. Remember the sermon about when I was hungry you did not feed me, because what you do for the least of these you also do unto me? I don\'t much think Jesus cares how we care for each other, as long as we do. A hungry kid doesn\'t care if dinner came from food stamps or from a loving donation. My guess is he would not think highly of a society that leaves issues like hunger and medical care to the whims of its donor class."'

S'"Great Scott\\\\nStephen F. Hayes\\\\nFebruary 20, 2012, Vol. 17, No. 22\\\\n\\\\nThroughout the 2012 election cycle Republicans have pined for a bold, conservative reformer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94a leader courageous enough to make difficult choices and articulate enough to explain them to a skeptical public. The good news is they have such a candidate. The less good news: Scott Walker isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t running for president. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s running to hang on to his job as governor of Wisconsin.\\\\n\\\\nWalker is the target of a recall effort funded by national labor unions. Why? Reforms he made to balance the budget have dramatically diminished the influence of public employee unions. If not reversed, these reforms will inspire similar efforts across the country, and the outsized power of public sector unions will finally be reined in.\\\\n\\\\nThe election in Wisconsin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which will happen in late spring or summer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94could have a profound impact on the 2012 presidential race, with the winning side emerging from the battle organized and energized in one of the most important swing states this November.\\\\n\\\\nWalker came to office in the Republican wave of 2010. He inherited a mess. Under his profligate predecessor, Jim Doyle, state government had operated almost as a slush fund for public employee unions. Giveaways to teachers and others put the state on an unsustainable fiscal path, so Doyle raised some taxes and threatened to raise others. He raided a state fund set up to cover medical liability, essentially stealing contributions doctors had made to the pooled account. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against that pilfering, but the money had already been spent. Even after budget gimmickry that would make Fannie and Freddie blush, the official deficit was $3.6 billion.\\\\n\\\\nJust over a year later, Walker and the Republicans in the state legislature have nearly eliminated the deficit. For the two-year budget cycle, the state will show a $143 million shortfall because the stagnant economy has resulted in lower tax receipts than had been projected. But the shortfall is for the first half of the cycle; Wisconsin will run a surplus in the current fiscal year. And Walker said last week that he will eliminate the remaining shortfall without raising taxes. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a credible claim. He reduced the deficit without raising taxes. In fact, one of his first moves upon being sworn in was to cut taxes on businesses. His subsequent reforms have allowed property tax receipts to go down for the first time in years\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94by some $47 million.\\\\n\\\\nThe recall vote Walker faces comes because of these results. The key to his success was his restructuring of health and retirement benefits for many state employees, asking them to contribute 5.8 percent of their salary to their pensions (up from 1 percent or less) and to pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums (up from 6 percent or so).\\\\n\\\\nEven some of the governor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s harshest critics acknowledged that such changes were reasonable. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWalker is right about one thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d wrote Eugene Robinson, liberal columnist for the Washington Post. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen it comes to pensions and benefits, public workers in Wisconsin have a sweet deal. .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x89. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy to see why the average private-sector worker in Wisconsin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94probably paying upward of 25 percent toward health insurance costs and struggling to tuck away something, anything for retirement\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94might agree with Walker.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWalker understood from his years as Milwaukee County Executive that such changes could not occur without dramatic reforms of collective bargaining for public employee unions. So he proposed them, and Republicans in the state legislature made them law. The reforms also ended compulsory union membership.\\\\n\\\\nThe unions correctly understood these changes as a mortal threat. Without compulsory membership, unions would lose a major source of funds. And without the ability to bargain collectively for benefits, the unions would lose their most compelling argument to convince public employees to contribute a chunk of their income\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94in many cases more than $1,000 per year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94for the privilege of membership. So they took to the streets in massive numbers and pressured the Democrats they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d elected to do everything possible to sabotage Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan. Democrats in the state senate fled to Illinois. Protesters occupied the state capitol. The fight captured national attention for months in 2011.\\\\n\\\\nThe unions lost that battle, but they did not give up the war. They launched an aggressive effort to recall several Republicans in the state senate with the hope of reversing the reforms before it became clear that they were working. They spent heavily\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94an estimated $30 million\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and lost again.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the results of the changes began coming in. In Milwaukee, the reforms saved some $11 million, an embarrassing windfall for Democratic mayor Tom Barrett, who had predicted that the city\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s structural deficit would \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cexplode.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Localities across the state have seen similar savings. There is no disputing the central fact of Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tenure as governor: His reforms are working.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a huge problem for the public employee unions as they try to convince Wisconsinites that the man responsible for this dramatic turnaround should be recalled. So they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re focusing on two other issues: his 2010 campaign and an investigation into the activities of former Walker employees.\\\\n\\\\nTheir first complaint is that Walker didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t campaign on the specific changes he would make to collective bargaining. Walker concedes that there is some truth to the claim. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t more specific, he says today, because he did not yet know exactly how he would make the changes to collective bargaining. But Walker is conceding too much. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t provide a point-by-point proposal to restrict collective bargaining, but it was no mystery that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make dramatic changes. Ryan Murray, a top policy adviser to Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s 2010 campaign, made that clear to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in describing the changes to public employee health and retirement benefits. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe way the proposal would work is we would take the choice out of the collective bargaining process,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said in comments published on August 29, 2010.\\\\n\\\\nDid that mean an end to collective bargaining over benefits? The reporter certainly seemed to think so. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c[Murray] said school districts often have some of the most expensive health benefits in Wisconsin and could receive cheaper insurance through the state if they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to negotiate with unions about who would insure their members.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Christina Brey, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the leading teachers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 union, had the same understanding. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOur members oppose taking away their rights to collective bargaining, so they would definitely raise their voices against it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Another teachers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 union, the American Federation of Teachers, distributed flyers to its members warning that Walker would \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cvoid parts of labor contracts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94something that couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t happen without changes to collective bargaining laws.\\\\n\\\\nIn light of the success of Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s reforms, complaining about what he said in 2010 seems unlikely to win many votes. So Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s opponents want to change the subject. Last week, Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic party, toured the state in an attempt to link Walker more closely to an investigation of some of his former employees. Here again, Democrats have resorted to distorting reality in order to smear Walker.\\\\n\\\\nThere are two separate issues. In the first, a woman who worked for Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive was found posting political comments on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s website during working hours. She resigned in May 2010.\\\\n\\\\nThe second involves two former Walker employees who allegedly stole money from a veterans\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 organization that worked with the county on an event held at the Milwaukee County Zoo. John Chisholm, Milwaukee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s district attorney, has been investigating the claims for 20 months. There is no indication Walker knew about the employees\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 activities, much less condoned them. Chisholm has said that Walker is not a target of the investigation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94which only exists because Walker requested it when he was presented with the facts.\\\\n\\\\nSome Wisconsin Republicans, pointing out that Chisholm is a Democrat and highlighting the steady stream of leaks coming from his office, are growing concerned that the investigation is a political witch hunt, designed to bloody the governor before voters cast their ballots. Walker, for his part, says that he believes Chisholm is an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cearnest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d prosecutor who will conduct a fair investigation. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s probably overly generous.\\\\n\\\\nThe coming battle for Wisconsin will be a difficult fight for Republicans. Democrats have shown that they are willing to do just about anything to win. Unions are fighting this battle as if their very existence depends on a victory\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94and it might.\\\\n\\\\nFor conservatives, the fight is about much more than one man in one state. A Walker defeat would send a message that political courage does not pay and political thuggery does. Walker doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like to talk about the effect the past year has had on him and his family, but it hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been pleasant. He has been subjected to numerous death threats. His wife, Tonette, has been verbally assaulted more times than she can count. His two teenaged boys have been targeted on Facebook. His modest home in Wauwatosa has been the site of several union protests. Last month, a protester outside Walker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s State of the State speech told State Senator John Kleefisch that his wife, Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, is a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cf\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94ing whore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWalker has been willing to endure these attacks to turn his state around and defend conservative principles. Conservatives should rally behind him.\\\\n"'

S. 815, 831-3 (1971) [CONTINUED]\\n.....\\n "There are at least intimations in the decided cases that a dual national constitutionally may be required to make an election. In Perkins v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325, 307 U. S. 329 (1939), the Court observed that a native-born citizen who had acquired dual nationality during minority through his parents\' foreign naturalization abroad did not lose his United States citizenship "provided that, on attaining majority, he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties." In Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. at 343 U. S. 734, the Court noted that a dual national, "under certain circumstances," can be deprived of his American citizenship through an Act of Congress. In Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U. S. 133, 344 U. S. 138 (1952), the Court took pains to observe that there was no statute in existence imposing an election upon that dual nationality litigant.\\n\\nThese cases do not flatly say that a duty to elect may be constitutionally imposed. They surely indicate, however, that this is possible, and, in Mandoli, the holding was based on the very absence of a statute, and not on any theory of unconstitutionality. And all three of these cases concerned persons who were born here, that is, persons who possessed Fourteenth Amendment citizenship; they did not concern a person, such as plaintiff Bellei, whose claim to citizenship is wholly, and only, statutory.""'

When I wrote about Things Professors Do that Irritate Students (http://www.profkrg.com/things-professors-do-that-irritate-students), keeping students late was one of the main things students mentioned.

Obama can blow smoke up the publics skirt all he want to but the S&P and other credit agencies are not going to be fooled in the least. They\'ve already warned of another downgrade and why? Because they don\'t see ANY real progress being made on Obama\'s part to intellegently and pragmatically address the issue in a published\\\\xc2\\\\xa0plan. And, the reason they haven\'t is because the president has no interest in cutting spending as long as he can borrow from China, et.al.\\\\n\\\\nThe only way out of this mess is with private business growth and if anything can be said of the last\\\\xc2\\\\xa03.5 years it\'s that if Obama is really really good at anything it\'s squashing growth.

S'"Additional thoughts based on other people\'s info:\\n\\n1. I kind of agree with the being a SmackDown star thought though eventually I think Bryan should have a legit shot at the title. Maybe just blatantly move him to Raw, so he can. And please don\'t mention Tensai. The guy is not ready to challenge Punk for the title and hopefully never will be,\\n\\n2. Ew, Big Show? Even when I used to despise Show for his booking, I would never say ew. Seriously, who says that?\\n\\n3. None of you guys really pointed out the fact that this is only falling in line for Jericho. He won\'t come back immediately. He is touring with Fozzy now and will be gone a lot of the summer. The only one who is hurt is Orton who we get to right afterwards.\\n\\n4. Wait, why are we talking about two newcomers getting their very first PPV match against the face of SmackDown? Sandow and Cesaro are not at a point that they should be wrestling against Orton. Miz would be a good choice if he weren\'t falling so far and so fast lately. I stand by Ziggler or Judas\' idea of having Orton be the special guest referee.\\n\\n5. Raw had at least the Punk/Bryan segment. Also, when you say there is no tag team division, you seem to miss the fact that the division is in full rebuild right now. Everyone from the Usos to Darren Young and Titus O\'Neil to Hawkins and Reks to the AW stable is stepping up and finding a place. In fact, the least fluid team right now might be the champions who still don\'t feel like a real tag team or a serious threat. As far as SmackDown vs. Impact, I agreed with the guys on Impact, but you guys are sometimes underscoring SmackDown which was very solid story-wise and especially wrestling-wise.\\n\\n6. Yeah, obvious the TNA move was positive while the Raw move is polarizing.\\n\\n7. Wow, a lot of Hogan lovers. "He made the show better." "Best mic work of his career." What? Hogan was great on the mic in the 80s and 90s. He has not improved. He has lost his wits and charisma for the most part. Laurinaitis plays his role to perfection, and he brought about the great Extreme Rules PPV. He is a long term storyline, taking over the company one step at a time. Hogan has not improved programming. The creative team has just come up with a couple good ideas since Hogan arrived. Sorry, but at least Laurinaitis doesn\'t have an easy replacement.\\n\\n8. Btw, Sean, you aren\'t ahead of me anymore. I went for a perfect 20 at Over the Limit putting me in clear first. Second, I see some of your points, and Shelley could work. I just think Morgan has to be the choice now. It could end up being wrong, but Shelley is a much less safe and much more long term choice.\\n\\n9. I stick by what I said. Sting shouldn\'t be wrestling any more. He doesn\'t have the skill or the presence he once had. He is just a symbol being hopelessly dragged around by TNA desperately.\\n\\n10. Wait, so no Angle then? Then it will probably be Sting. If not, people need to realize that Roode has feuded with Hardy already. He has feuded with Styles already. Basically, that means it is someone fresh like Austin Aries or Samoa Joe. Or it\'s Anderson who has been built to it. So I guess I\'ll say I hope it\'s Anderson over Sting, but it will probably be Sting."'

S. 815, 831-3 (1971)(a case involving statutory citizenship forfeiture, discussing dual citizenship/dual allegiance):\\n\\n"The Congress has an appropriate concern with problems attendant on dual nationality. Savornan v. United States, 338 U. S. 491, 338 U. S. 500 (1950); N. Bar-Yaacov, Dual Nationality xi and 4 (1961). These problems are particularly acute when it is the father who is the child\'s alien parent and the father chooses to have his family reside in the country of his own nationality. The child is reared, at best, in an atmosphere of divided loyalty. We cannot say that a concern that the child\'s own primary allegiance is to the country of his birth and of his father\'s allegiance is either misplaced or arbitrary.\\n\\nThe duality also creates problems for the governments involved. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN recognized this when, concurring in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 372 U. S. 187 (1963), a case concerning native-born citizens, he observed: "We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance. . . ." In a famous case, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote of the problem of dual citizenship. Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717, 343 U. S. 723-736 (1952). He noted that "[o]ne who has a dual nationality will be subject to claims from both nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting," id. at 343 U. S. 733; that one with dual nationality cannot turn that status "into a fair-weather citizenship," id. at 343 U. S. 736; and that "[c]ircumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality to do acts which otherwise would not be compatible with the obligations of American citizenship," ibid.\\n ....

In some countries, people pay some small amount per doctor visit, like a co-pay. In other countries, you are covered, no co-pay. In most countries, the option to have private health insurance is always an option. This gives the wealthy or well-heeded access to some private doctors who want to only see rich patients. Their choice. \\nBut no one, no mom, dad, child, uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, sister, brother, business associate, boss, garbage man, ditch digger, or nuclear physicist goes bankrupt from a disease or medical condition like here in the USA. You need not fear the collection agency coming after you because you fell and broke your arm and had no insurance. No insurance company denies your claim or drops your coverage after finding out you have cancer or heart disease or MS. Get it? \\n\\nWe are in the dark ages of medical care in the US and the Neanderthal republicans want to keep it that way because their wealthy benefactors in the giant Insurance-Pharma industrial complex like it that way.

That deadline has come and gone, \\\\nand Holder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Department of Justice still hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t provided most of those \\\\ndocuments. Issa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subpoena dates back to Oct. 12, 2011.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOn Tuesday in a seven-page letter, Issa revealed that Deputy Attorney \\\\nGeneral James Cole begged Congress to extend the Feb. 9 deadline. Issa \\\\nwrote that the request was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cironic\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cignores the reality that the \\\\nDepartment has unreasonably delayed producing these documents to the \\\\nCommittee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn its face, the requested extension demonstrates a lack of good \\\\nfaith,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Issa wrote to Holder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith one exception, the Department has \\\\nonly produced documents responsive to the subpoena on the eve of \\\\ncongressional hearings in which senior Department officials testified. \\\\nThe Department appears to be more concerned with protecting its image \\\\nthrough spin control than actually cooperating with Congress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe cannot wait any longer for the Department\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cooperation,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Issa \\\\ncontinued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs such, please specify a date by which you expect the \\\\nDepartment to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In \\\\naddition, please specify a Department representative who will interface \\\\nwith the Committee for production purposes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIssa added that whoever Holder designates as the go-to DOJ official for \\\\ndelivering subpoenaed documents \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshould also serve as the conduit for \\\\ndealing with the contempt proceedings, should the Department continue to\\\\n ignore the Committee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subpoena.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (RELATED: Full coverage of Eric \\\\nHolder)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe California Republican slammed Holder, too, for claiming the \\\\ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious was a political game \\\\nfor Republicans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead more:'

S'"There is a certain contrasting quality between judgments within the world view of the proponents of the war on cannabis and Christian theology. The "everything is toxic" philosophy embraced by the ONDCP toxicologists and controlling offices such as the FDA and DEA is the exact opposite of sound Christian theology [1,2], and the corollary truths built upon it are not Biblically founded, and can be proven to be Biblically incorrect. -And if it\\\\\'s not Theologically true, if it\\\\\'s not true in the Bible, than it isn\\\\\'t true at all [3]. No Bible believing Christian can accept any "toxicology" studies or reports from the ONDCP in good conscience, when they consider the axioms that were used to build their studies. Do Christians adhere to "scientific" theories about big bang and evolution? No, and we can also reject the observations of the ONDCP about cannabis on similar grounds when all things are considered in a clear systematic theology. One must "Test The Evidences" that come from outside Scripture. Scripture, tradition, and reason imply that all things are good, and that substance (such as foods and drinks) only becomes toxic in it\\\\\'s misuse, that is, in the uses that are not in order with the purposes God created them [4]. The Scripture\\\\\'s warnings against these philosophies are traditionally viewed as warnings about the Gnostics of the second century. It was a blending of Jewish, Greek, or Eastern philosophy with Christianity. These Gnostic errors are widespread, they appear century after century, and shows itself in many forms of religion, not merely in distorted forms of Christianity. In life application today, we can see that same Gnostic germ resurface in our society in the influence of modernism and postmodernism. The war against cannabis is a frightening illustration, in that it is successful in stifling Evangelism within the local Church, and not many Leaders recognize what\\\\\'s going on, despite the fact that it devastates the lives of millions in perdition. This ascetic teaching is unnatural, contrary to the constitution of the world as that has been arranged by a holy and wise Creator, and it is also subversive of Christian liberty. Nothing can be esteemed common or unclean without throwing a reproach upon the Creator. [5] To further discover the long term consequences of these unnatural teachings, we can observe the characterizations and acts employed in the war on pot have a resemblance to the warnings in Scripture regarding the signs of false teachers (which are directly linked to signs of the coming Rapture of Christ\\\\\'s church). The war on cannabis shares at least 2 key qualities as the Gnostics. In the presence of the negative implications of statements such as "there is no way to teach this to you in a brief, " and, "everything is toxic, there is no harmless substances. ", the Christian should be reminded that encouraging formalism and asceticism as the result of false teaching is traditionally known as the activities of demons [6]; and the acknowledgment of liberty of conscience in a free moral agent is the formation of evangelical theology- for this very reason the Reformers left the Roman Catholic Church! [7]. The binge drinking phenomena we see in the just say no generation, as well as the licentious rebellion in the 60\\\\\'s, is evidences of the "fleshly indulgence", or antinomian development that results from these ascetic teachings. [8,9,10]To summarize; The Christian world view and the ONDCP world view can be sharply contrasted. In the ONDCP world view, the Truth is "everything is toxic" and application is "just say no". In the Christian world view, the Truth is "God\\\\\'s creation is good" and application is "be ye sober". The Scripture provides us a sharper, more accurate understanding and response to the subjects of cannabis use in society than the secular drug use prevention community. And as Biblical passages are weighed and discovered as this more accurate Truth, it should bear witness that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is Truth. We should lend thought to this greater spiritual Truth for which the Bible is compiled as evidence of; That Christ made atonement covering and salvation for our souls. "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that he world through him might be saved. God publicly displayed him as the mercy seat accessible through faith, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but by grace are you saved through faith, and it\\\\\'s not of yourselves, it is a gift from God. For whosoever believes in Him will not perish. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.""'

If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope and Change\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe The People,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\\\n\\\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\\\n\\\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s country.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s before me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cterrorists\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\\\n\\\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe The People\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.  Remember, it only takes one person to shut the whole freak show down.

S'"<blockquote>I mean, he\\\\\'s DEATH\\\\\'S BOYFRIEND. </blockquote>\\\\nThat\\\\\'s actually the exact point to which I refer:\\\\nThanos abandoned his love and need to appease Death during <i>The Infinity Gauntlet</i>. This was clear in anything and everything Starlin wrote following it (starting with <i>Infinity War</i>, which makes it pretty explicit, and was the next writing to feature Thanos\\\\xc2\\\\xb9), but boring, lame-o other writers couldn\\\\\'t be arsed to keep up and went, "What was his thing again...? Oh yeah, he\\\\\'s in love with Death!"\\\\nStarlin brought it up once after that, in <i>The End</i>, in which Thanos has clearly progressed far beyond that, but refers to her as his love all the same--though still in a way suggesting he had moved on, long ago, from pursuing this. She didn\\\\\'t appear at all in what was to be his ongoing series (until Marvel pissed Starlin off for good)--that is, until Keith Giffen took over for the last six issues of it.\\\\n\\\\nI say this with love for Ron Marz (I\\\\\'m a Kyle Rayner fan, even with his writing leading to an infamous comics-critical blog named for an event in *that* story...) and Keith Giffen. But everyone other than Starlin (including those two) tried to boil Thanos back down to a simplistic core: "He\\\\\'s the dude in love with Death!" Though, to be fair, Giffen and Marz at least had a handle on the tenuous nature of his villainy, and even that it was almost abandoned--indeed, Giffen supports his aim to prevent the destruction of the universe as he writes him.\\\\n\\\\nBut no, he <b>was</b> the lover of Death. The same as he was once a Darkseid knock-off of sorts. The same as he once pursued power purely for power\\\\\'s sake.\\\\xc2\\\\xa0 But those things all changed. Each story Starlin put him through over time gave him more and more dimension--as he asked himself at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>: "And what now are you, Lord Thanos? Hero? Villain? Neither? Maybe just wiser."\\\\n\\\\nIt was shameful the way an extremely rounded character kept being sanded back down to two dimensions every time someone else got their hands on him...I actually got into a fight with the editor of <i>Annihilation</i> over this, who told me that the storyline of Thanos in said book was to prevent exactly what I hated: lame writers screwing the character up further (so I apologized).\\\\n\\\\nI grew up going "Oooh! So many characters!!!" when I first saw <i>Infinity War</i> on newsstands, but was taken in by Thanos and his peculiar character, which was neither good nor evil, nor even amoral or simplistically "grey" or antihero. Everyone turning him back into "Oh, he\\\\\'s in love with Death and wants to be with Death," was always such a waste of potential...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xb9"Death has rejected me. Like it or not, Thanos of Titan is now one of the living. Life is change.""'

She IS living through those girls since she is never going to be a professional dancer and because they have young, strong, beautiful bodies.... Which she clearly is envious of.   She hates that she cannot intimidate you. \\\\n\\\\nI relate very much to your feelings as a mother and as a dancemom.   This is a difficult situation as a parent.  You are doing the right thing!!!  Abby has no boundaries... Quite literally.  She is trying to control everyone else, because she has clearly no personal boundaries whatsoever.   Our coach told us straight up that he does not want parents watching rehearsals because they won\\\\\'t be able to handle the harshness required.  And it is rough!!!!   But we win. Everything.   We even win on dancing with the stars.  Everytime.  We win.  The difference between Rick and Abby is simple: she is vicious and personally cruel.   It is unacceptable.  If she were a parent, childrens services would have had her kids removed.  Rick is tough at rehearsals without being personally vicious!!  Abby is destroying their psyche.  And poor Maddie will end up with PTSD because she clearly feels badly for the way chloe is treated.  It is so obvious!!  That even Maddie backstage feels terrible for Chloe.  Melissa would see that if she wasn\\\\\'t such a "mean girl" selling herself to pay for dance (talking about living through your kid!!  Wow.  She\\\\\'s a walking dysfunction.  Trust me Christi, you and Hollie would not be able to live with yourselves to act like she does to pander to Abbys insecurities.  She is a special kind of mess).  Melissa is far more nasty and catty about "Maddie is the best" than I have ever seen Maddie be.  Melissa acts as if it\\\\\'s her accomplishment!!  I don\\\\\'t see her out there dancing for hours! \\\\n\\\\nYou have a very challenging situation.  Keep handling it with strength and dignity!!  What Chloe learns about life and handling difficult people, whom we all have to deal with, is what is most important.  Stand up for what you know is best for your daughter!!  And don\\\\\'t engage with any one else who makes an ass of herself.   Keep your focus on not allowing Abby to negatively affect Chloe.   But don\\\\\'t worry about the moms as much, unless they say it in front of or to Chloe.  If she is unaffected by it, do not engage them.   Jill is so freaking insecure because she can\\\\\'t buy enough goodwill to make Kendall a quality dancer.  She doesn\\\\\'t have core strength.  She doesnt have strong technique.  She is simply an immature dancer.  If the mom would put half the energy she spends bribing Abby into helping Kendall, she could become a stronger dancer!!!  Jill is a nightmare.  Let her live in that nightmare all by herself.   Let no mom speak with her for a couple of weeks until she can clean up her act.   Shut her out.   So that she does not affect you guys.  You all have enough pressure!! \\\\n\\\\nNow.... The catholic school girl costumes for the bullying number.... First the irony was so rich!!!  And Abby is clueless.  Second, our girls had the exact same costume for a lyrical number.  My sons was just watching that number and I was livid!!!  We were at the emerald ball in LA (I love how Abby name drops LA and NYC all the time).  We are all over the country every single weekend and sometimes entire week.  We have ballroom teams and regular girls lyrical/jazz/tap type teams.  When these girls walked out looking like living child porn, the entire ballroom of adult competitors and professionals gasped.   It was repulsive.   The number had gyrating, overly sexual moves, with the girls doing spilt legs with their crotches aimed at the audience.   I about died!!  Did some guy turn this team into a living vignette of his favorite porno?!?  We did not have the fishnet stockings.  I would have loved the fishnets over the thigh highs our girls were wearing!!   I am very proud to see you moms stand up and say "No!! These are children!!"  I cheered when I saw you have such an impact!   Our teams moms decided to make it goofy so it would not get the reaction we got in LA:  after gasping when the girls walked on, there were no cheers, no clapping, dead awkward and uncomfortable silence!!  Broken up only by other gasps!   It was embarrassing.  Such bad taste level.  These are almost all Mormon children competing.  This was just atrocious.  I am hoping the dance moms learned something from watching you stand up for what is right. All our moms did was put swim googles on the girls to make it look more goofy.   It did work.   The short skirts, the little panties crotch aimed at the audience, and gyrating pre-teens looking like walking porn was not mitigated one bit by swim googles. \\\\n\\\\nCHLOE:  you are not snotty.  You have never exhibited a mouthy or cocky attitude.  That is Abbys projection on you.  Because if she had been born as pretty as you are and as talented as you are, SHE would be a total brat to everyone!!   So she assumes your a nasty bratty girl.  It is obvious to everyone watching how gentle and kind and sweet and generous you are!!!  You deserve to walk tall!!!  Every time Abby berated you, tune her out!!  Put her voice far away in the background and tell yourself, america is watching Abby make herself look like absolute jerk!!  And we all think you are an incredibly strong and elegant dancer!!!!  And phenomenal for your age.  I would not lie to you kid!!  You are phenomenal!!  I promise everyone sees that. Even Abby ;)  everytime she picks at you, she is doing it because she is so stinking jealous of you she can\\\\\'t stand it!!!   She will never ever be as beautiful and as talented and kind and wonderful of a person as you are.  Smile, because every snotty thing she says or does reveals her ugliness to us and shows everyone how terribly jealous she is of YOU!!  You are a remarkable young woman!!  And an incredibly strong dancer!   There is good reason for Abby to be so jealous of you!!  Everyone should ;)  who wouldn\\\\\'t want to be Chloe!!!  She is a fabulous person and a dynamic dancer!!   Abby can never take that from you.  So don\\\\\'t give it to her.  You are amazing!!"'

Industrialism was also one of them. Many of our founding father\'s had slaves up until the time that Lincoln set them free.\\\\n\\\\nOh... and slavery was the white man putting the black man in the yoke of the plow? Sorry but blacks sold blacks into slavery, that is how the white people got them. But the truth does not end there. Whites and native americans were also slaves. If you are still disillusioned Africa still has a slavery problem with blacks are kidnapping blacks and .... selling them into slavery.\\\\n\\\\nBlacks should get over slavery because you are not slaves, you have not been slaves. Those who were slaves, the ones who had a right to be pissed about it are now dead. Move on and concetrate on making the most out of your life that you can.\\\\n\\\\nBlacks fighting for America? No I\'m not one of those who thought they didn\'t fight until WW2 but I\'m sure that many blacks don\'t know or refuse to acknowledgs that there were free blacks who fought for the south against the north. \\\\n\\\\nI am not racist. \\\\n\\\\nBut I am damn tired of someone expecting something because the color of their skin. When I was in high school a black boy came to me and said \'move over\'. I replied \'No.\' He went and told the vice principal that I wouldn\'t allow him to sit down because he was black. I only wish I had had the courage to speak up and say that it was because he was rude. Had he asked politely I would have shared my seat.\\\\n\\\\nDuring highschool I endure quietly being struck in the back of the head by black girls because I was white. I had to endure vicious teasing from them because I was white. To what civic group to I complain to to get justice for this?\\\\n\\\\nI once worked in a video arcade where a young black girl grabbed a moving game and held on to it so that the alarm went off. She must have been four so I crouched down not to over whem her, talked softly and told her the game was ment to be hit with the mallet and she couldn\'t hold on to the pieces. Her father started screaming at me for correcting his child because she didn\'t know any better and threated to cause me physical harm. I had to run to my office while his wife tried to pull him away. Of course she didn\'t know any better that is why i explained how to play the game to her... and you call me racist?\\\\n\\\\nI believe that black\'s still have problems because they don\'t want to let go of the excuse... \'if something doesn\'t go my way it must be because I am black\'... not that you could have behaved better or worked harder... or just like the rest of us poor white folks... sometimes you just don\'t get what you want."'

S'"So I\'m first going to comment on the school lunch issue, because I\'ve had a similar experience. It was brought to my attention that my kids were buying lunch, but not eating it. I decided to pack their lunch. My kids will not eat a sandwich so I decided I was not going to waste food or money packing a sandwich and instead substituted cheese and crackers or peanut butter crackers, which is an appropriate substitute for grain/meat. I then packed carrots, a fruit (generally an orange or apple) or a fruit cup, and a granola bar (also a grain alternative. I was sent a note home that it was unacceptable to not have a sandwich included in their lunch. I worked at the time in the lunch room of a day care and knew what was acceptable and unacceptable according to the USDA, but in my opinion what the USDA requires of a public facility offering lunch and what I offer should be totally seperate. The eating habits of my children is my business, their health is in my hands. I feel sorry for children whose parents choose to set bad examples, and for parents that don\'t care enough and let their children live off of take out and junk but that is their choice. \\\\nI will now address the abortion issue that was thrown in just because I find it A) outrageous to even mention it, and B) because people are uneducated and base take things out of context or base it off of hearsay and uneducated opinions. I personally don\'t believe it\'s right in all circumstances. I believe there are other options, I believe that their are also situations where it may be necessary, medically, or mentally; as in a rape case. BUT I also believe that it is our bodies, we do in fact own them, the fetus is a person but it is not seperated from you until birth, which makes it yours until then. State has enough power already, controlling what I do with my body is my business. I don\'t believe they should be allowed to tell me I can or can\'t have one. I also don\'t think all insurance companies should have to pay for it, unless of course it\'s a medically neccessary procedure due to health risks of the mother, the fetus or in the case of rape/incest. I don\'t think insurance companies should be allowed to tell you that you can\'t buy birth control, that is taking it to far. I realize certain religions don\'t believe in birth control, they believe that if God wants you to have a baby he\'ll give you one but he didn\'t put these people on Earth that invented these things for nothing. If there was a flood and a boat came by I would get in, I wouldn\'t wait for God, God sent the boat. I wish people would realize that this country is religiously diverse, it was founded on religious diversity, state and religion should be seperate and publicly owened companies (company\'s with stock on NASDAQ etc.) and religion should be seperate. No religion has the right to enforce their beliefs on others. It\'s sad to say that as Christian, especially of the Baptist denomination that is more frequent than in any other religion. The religion that worships Alla (sp) doesn\'t ask that everyone bow down for 10 minutes at high noon for prayer, Catholics don\'t require or ask other religions to go to confession, Jews don\'t ask that more Jewish holidays be made official government holidays. The Baptist scream for Christmas, and Easter and anti abortion (as do the Catholic on that one (they are a denomination of Christians). I just think people need less power and more tolerance of others. Jesus/God was not a judgemental person, in fact he was the opposite of that, he taught acceptance and love of all, even those that turned away from him. We could all learn from that, quit thumping your Bible and actually read it. "'

Some songs can happen instantly - but some songwriters might spend the same amount of time on a great song as someone might spend writing a whole book. That all being said - for creative artist type writing - when you have to write something for a film or TV show ASAP, or have a deadline to get a song to an artist - you just have to do it and not make such a big deal out of it all. After you do it a number of times you gain confidence and no longer doubt the inevitable favorable outcome of your efforts - in fact you totally enjoy the intense focus and process. If you are getting freaky, overwhelmed, stressed or grumpy about any aspect - that is writer\'s stage fright - eventually you will find that to be unnecessary & counter productive.

Most non-believers, especially former Christians, have CONSIDERED YOUR CONCLUSIONS BEFORE, but most Christians have not considered \\nthe things I say. You are interesting. I\'ll grant you that. Perhaps what interests them is something Dr. Valerie Tarico said of my magnum opus:<blockquote>What is unusual about Loftus is his breadth and depth of research in \\ndefense of the Christian faith before finally rejecting his faith. \\nLoftus applies himself in this book with the same intellectual rigor he \\nhad applied to defending the faith, and effectively dissects those very \\nsame arguments.

They are worth reading from the standpoint of \\ncognitive psychology alone.</blockquote>You illustrate this better than most every other Christian apologist out there."'

S'"Gosh, Peggy Hill ... Don\'t make me laugh. In addition to money, Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is likely a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance. Both will do the basically the same things in office just with entirely different styles. Newt ruffles feathers all day long with his growing obsession to draw stark contrasts all of the time ... especially when if and when it entails lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV, unbelievable. \\\\n\\\\nAnd since Peggy Hill knows less about national politics than I do since I have studied it to some degree for 25 odd years, I\'m not inclined to be persuaded by her often amateurish, yet heartfelt, patriotic opinions. She describes the political scene the way I used to 15 years ago ... lots of generalities with little to no expertise, so I don\'t pay her a lot of attention when we disagree. In fairness, her scope of knowledge, when it comes to national politics, is growing by the day. I feel she would be competent to run for VP in 2016 but I would much rather see her in a Dept of Energy position since she gets on my nerves from time to time (though not badly) and I don\'t trust her instincts as much these days since she wants Mitt out of the race ... the one guy who is sure to beat Owebamao! Of course she hasn\'t said she wants Mitt out but we all know she does because she is behind Newt, 100%.\\\\n\\\\nSarah Palin is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake! Newt is the world\'s best field general but his temper and tone are starting to wear on me and I\'m conservative, for Pete\'s sake ... I can only imagine how offended some Independents are beginning to feel. \\\\n\\\\nSure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... and that is essential in beating Dingle Barry, as well. Sarah kinda sounds like an OWS\'er ranting that Mitt had too much money as if Newt wouldn\'t have wanted to have that much money, too. And thank God Mitt raised all that cash ... after all ... that\'s what it\'s all about! So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol.\\\\n\\\\nIf Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he\'s got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that\'s all Barry does. But in fairness to Newt ... that was just a cheapshot as Newt would destroy Owebamao ... any time, any place! ;-D\\\\n\\\\nI don\'t obsess over the fact that Mitt Romney is uninspiring even though I wish he was, naturally. I know he will beat Owebamao (all that matters) and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket. My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney.\\\\n\\\\nBy the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out.\\\\n\\\\nBut for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable .... that\'s what you\'re supposed to do!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBTW Folks - Remember the Sirens???\\\\n\\\\nBeautiful half-woman, half-bird, Newt-like creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot about everything including their own safety. The Sirens were Newtish sisters who lured sailors to their untimely deaths. The songs of the Sirens were irresistible but they resided beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroyed the sailors\' boat (think Costa Concordia) when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew\'s ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship\'s mast, thus finally allowing the GOP to win their prize ........ just sayin\'."'

Somehow he became convinced that the same would happen to Earth, even though the necessary vulcanism, proximity to the sun, lack of a biosphere and water cycle and atmospheric composition are all totally non-Earth like. But he is convinced we\\\\\'ll turn Earth into a new Venus, even though we can\\\\\'t, and the fact that his projections are failing badly means that his acolytes and people not even aware of where this crap came from are now inventing non-physical tipping points at unknown times in the near future to justify continuing panic.

Around 04-06 they were fighting and both was arrested for domestic abuse.\\n\\nWhy do I bring this up you ask? We as black people need to take better strides to date better people and stay "drama free" . When you are "messy" with your relationships bull-shit is going to happen.  (But we black folks love drama.......smh)\\n\\nThis woman did not deserve to be burned nor her car should towed, but the warning signs were all there when she started dating this crazy dude.

That way she can look at their page if she feels like it but she won\'t be seeing more than she really wants to know. \\n\\nI have to agree though that writing about awesome presents you received or how much you really love, love, love your awesome BF, or telling everyone about your Valentines plans - seems a little like what CH called over sharing.  I guess because it\'s not the kind of the info that I would think about announcing.  For example, if my husband gives me an awesome gift - I don\'t rush to the phone to call everyone I know and tell them or even do a mass email to let everyone know.  Same with plans for special occasions.  \\n\\nIf someone asks me - then of course I\'ll tell them.  But the announcing to the world thing does seem a little over the top when it comes to things like that.  But then, that\'s the kind of world we live in - people twittering their every move.  Someone must be interested.  And I think that it can become a sort of habit to post everything on facebook, to the point where I doubt that they\'re really thinking that much about it.  \\n\\nI think the LW should just ignore it - she doesn\'t have to \'do\' facebook the way everyone else does.
